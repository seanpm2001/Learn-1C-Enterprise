### Learning 1C Enterprise

I am not too experienced with 1C Enterprise at the moment, and I don't intend to go very far with it. This document will go over my knowledge of the 1C Enterprise language so far.

This document used version ? of the 1C Enterprise programming language.

#### Comments in 1C Enterprise

Comments in 1C Enterprise are the same as comments in languages like C, C++, Java, C#, etc.

```1c-enterprise
// This is a single line comment
// 1C Enterprise does not support multi-line comments (as far as I know)
```

#### Break keyword in 1C Enterprise

```1c-enterprise
break
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Hello World in 1C Enterprise

A hello world program in 1C Enterprise is pretty simple. It is not similar to any language I am currently familiar with.

```1c-enterprise
&AtClient
Procedure HW(Command)
	Message("Hello World");	
EndProcedure
```

#### Source

The majority of my 1C Enterprise knowledge comes from Wikipedia, and [this repository](https://github.com/leachim6/hello-world)

#### Other knowledge of 1C Enterprise

1. 1C Enterprise is not curly bracket language, but it does use semicolons at the end of each line

2. I discovered 1C Enterprise through Quora, as it was noted as a programming language that supports the Cyrillic script.

3. 1C Enterprise uses the `.bsl` file extension

4. 1C Enterprise is a language recognized by GitHub

5. I don't know if 1C Enterprise is an open source language or not

6. No other knowledge of Lua at the moment.
